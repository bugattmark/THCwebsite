# Mission and Vision

**What are we leading?**  
We started late September as a non-profit community initiative with a single goal: to build the central node for "hackathon hungry" students in London.

\- The Network: As of Late November, \~400 active members (UCL, KCL, Imperial), plus connections into Oxford and Cambridge.

\- The Utility: Our Verified Luma Calendar is the **fastest source** of truth for a suitable London hackathon circuit for UOL students.

**\- The Goal: We are purely focused on density right now. We are on track to hit 1,000 active members within 6 months.**

**Future State: The Pivot**  
We’ve had strategic interest (including recommendations from a member on the Kickstart Global team) to pivot immediately into an incubator model: bridging the gap between hackathon MVPS to PMF by connecting builders with VCs and mentors, and other founders.

However, I believe pivoting now would be naive.

We are holding off on any revenue models until we hit our density targets. We know there is a massive market gap for connecting companies with student builders (specifically observing teams "in the wild" on Saturdays and Sundays), but we are choosing to build the community first.

**Architecture**  
**(Don’t publicise)** THC sources hackathons from internal discussions in Builder’s Brew, Unicorn Mafia, Tech Europe, and words of mouth. THC connects people from university societies, as well. With the network, THC became the BEST central source for hackathon information.

The target audience for THC is (**and should remain**) as **generalists who are hackathon-hungry**. 

**Partnerships & Connections**  
THC x Hacker’s Unity \>\> Lifetime partnership to co-host a GLOBAL HACKATHON.

THC x Kickstart Global \>\> Kickstart Global provides venue space for any hackathons hosted/co-hosted by THC.

THC x Hackathon Radar \>\> Discord server led by **Keanu** w/ 150+ members. We can plan a merge/ migration but more discussion is needed with Keanu. 

THC x Unmasked (**STILL TO BE DETERMINED**) \>\> startup for connecting hackathon-winning students to companies. Led by **Henry Allen**. We can have THC on their platform. 

THC x Hackeurope: Not an official partnership, but Hackeurope requests that we refer 10 people from our community to their competition. **REVIEW HACKEUROPE DETAILS TAB** for this

**TO DOs**  
Gabriel \+ Bulut, the first 4 things below are what I need from you guys:  
1\. **\[ONGOING\]** Promote & connect with more societies, for example, Birkbeck, LSE, City Saint George, etc.

2\. \[**ONGOING\]** Develop OUR socials on X or INSTAGRAM or both.

3\. **\[ONGOING\]** Keep adding Luma events from the chat to the Calendar \+ label them with tags.

4\. **REVIEW THC x HU ONBOARDING.**   
We aim to Co-host THC x Hacker’s Unity events (workshops, tutorials, **AND A GLOBAL HACKATHON**), so we have to do a few tasks:

+ THC to survey UCL students for exam timetable/availability **TO GIVE A DATE RANGE ON WHEN THE HACKATHON SHOULD BE HOSTED.** India unavailable until after January (exam period), UK February onwards likely optimal timing.  
+ Follow-up coordination via WhatsApp group chat

5\. Co-host a Trae x THC x Kickstart Global hackathon. Trae is basically Cursor IDE but Chinese. They want to host a UK hackathon but logistics are hard, THC can connect them with Kickstart Global to provide venue spacing. THC can also connect with Swift UK to provide pizzas.

—-  
The Direct next thing I’ll do is make a LinkedIn post to promote the group. I WANT US to reach 1,000 members AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

I’ve sent y’all the links to join both Builder’s Brew and Unicorn Mafia. You guys should definitely join them.
